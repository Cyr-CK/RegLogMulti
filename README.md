## Shiny Application Guide

### Data Management
1. Open the **Data** tab to upload your dataset in `.csv` or `.xlsx` format.
2. View the dataset structure and detect missing values.
3. Impute missing values using available options for both qualitative and quantitative features.

### Preprocessing
1. Navigate to the **Preprocessing** tab.
2. Apply transformations such as:
   - One-Hot Encoding for categorical variables.
   - Scaling techniques like Standard Scaler, Min-Max Scaler, or Robust Scaler for numerical features.
3. Use the **FAMD** method to analyze mixed data and reduce dimensionality.

### Model Training
1. Go to the **Training** tab.
2. Configure model parameters, including:
   - Learning rate.
   - Optimizer type (e.g., Adam, SGD).
   - Regularization (L1, L2).
